- Designed and built the mood detection and communication device, to strengthen the parent-children bounding at long distance. The team consists of engineers from HKUST and designers from Chinese Art Academy.
- Design: I combined the moon phase with the changing mood of people, and used moon's metaphor as 'family union', hoping to strength the communication and bounding within each family. 
- Technology: I integrated the facial expression detection to detect the mood of a person, and use socket transmission to realize the mood exchange.
