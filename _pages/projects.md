- Designed and built the mood detection and communication device, to strengthen the parent-children bounding at long distances. The team consists of engineers from HKUST and designers from the Chinese Art Academy.
- **Design:** I combined the moon phase with the changing mood of people, and used the moon's metaphor as 'family union', hoping to strengthen the communication and bonding within each family. 
- **Technology:** I integrated facial expression detection to detect the mood of a person, and use socket transmission to realize the mood exchange.
