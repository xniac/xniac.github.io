Biograph
======
Xiaoyuan NI is a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). He is a passionate researcher in the fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV). His research interests include reinforcement learning and video recognition, and devoted to AI applications in the real-world context.

He has rich experience in both the academics and the industry field. He conducted researches in few-shot action recognition under the supervision of [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/cktang) and conveyed the UROP Program in pedestrian tracking and human reidentification under the supervision of [Prof. Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/). Besides, he worked as a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and researched the reinforcement learning application in Combinatorial Optimization problems. He worked as a software development intern at Tencent for quality assurance and Fesco Adecco for billing system development.
